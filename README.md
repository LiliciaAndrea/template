<h2>template</h2>

<p>A base template for starting projects. Features:</p>
<ul>
	<li>a full CSS library with reset, form and typographic base styles, and useful layout classes.</li>
	<li>useful JS and jQuery extensions including transition class handling and form validation.</li>
	<li>HTML5 template.</li>
</ul>
<p>Major parts of this template are purloined from other sources. Credit is given in comments in the source.</p>
<p>All files are ignored unless specifically included in .gitignore (making it is safe to commit to <b>template</b> when the project has already added other files).</p>

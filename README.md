<h2>template</h2>

<p>A base HTML/CSS/JS template for starting projects.</p>
<p>Major parts of this template are purloined from other sources. Credit is given in comments in the source.</p>
<p>All files are ignored unless specifically included in .gitignore (making it is safe to commit to <b>template</b> when the project has already added other files).</p>

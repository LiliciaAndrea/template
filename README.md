<h3>Todo notes</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Something wrong with making a default tab open, and giving it and its tab_button class .active.</li>
  <li>.transition class is not being removed from tabs.</li>
  <li>.class active for filters - this should be automatic, based on their associated inputs... there's a script for that somewhere, I'm surprised it's not in the template project, but it's time to find it...</li>
</ul>

<h2>inspector branch</h2>

<p>Template for creating inspector iframes.</p>
